Since January 1, 2015, China‚Äôs central environmental ministry, now known as the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE), has been publishing continuous, real-time hourly measurements of PM2.5 in 363 Chinese cities. These data are publicly accessible for 48 hours, after which they are removed from the MEE website.

üìç Beijing

The air pollution data collection structure in China is multi-level and involves collaboration between national, provincial, and local agencies. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) formulates national policies and standards, coordinates the national monitoring system, and publishes national reports. Provincial environmental departments implement MEE's responsibilities at the provincial level and report their findings to the MEE. Urban departments are responsible for policy implementation and managing local monitoring stations. Air quality monitoring stations collect data on pollutants and send it to higher levels. This data, after processing by the MEE, is made publicly available through websites and applications.

üìç India

The air pollution data collection structure in India is multi-level and involves collaboration among government, local, and non-governmental organizations. The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) formulates national policies and collects data. The National Air Quality Monitoring Program (NAMP) manages a network of monitoring stations that continuously collect data on pollutants like PM2.5 and NO‚ÇÇ. Local environmental agencies analyze this data and report it to NAMP. Processed data is publicly available through websites and apps for real-time updates on air quality.
Some of these websites for Beijing are as follows:
- [MoEFCC Website](http://moef.gov.in/): Hosts policies, reports, and air quality data.
- [NAMP Website](http://namp.india.gov.in/): Manages data from monitoring stations.
- [Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)](http://cpcb.nic.in/): Regularly publishes reports on air pollution.

üìç South Korea

The structure for collecting air pollution data in South Korea is systematically organized, involving collaboration among governmental, research, and local agencies. The Ministry of Environment (MOE) formulates national policies and standards for air quality and collects data from monitoring stations nationwide. The National Environmental Corporation Agency (NECA) oversees and manages the air quality monitoring network, collecting data, analyzing it, and publishing reports. Local environmental agencies implement the functions of MOE and NECA at the local level, monitoring air quality in cities and reporting results. Air quality monitoring stations across the country continuously collect data on various pollutants, which is sent to relevant organizations. This data is publicly released after processing, allowing citizens to access real-time air quality information through websites and mobile applications. South Korea also collaborates with international organizations to share data and adopt best practices for improving air quality.
In South Korea, several reputable websites collect and publish data related to air pollution and the environment. Here are some of the key websites:

- [Ministry of Environment Website](https://me.go.kr/home/web/main.do): Information on policies and regulations for environmental issues in South Korea.
- [Air Quality Monitoring Platform](https://www.airkorea.or.kr/eng/): Real-time air quality data for various pollutants.

The Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) is an atmospheric model developed by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). It provides analyses four times daily (at 0, 6, 12, and 18 UTC) along with 3-, 6-, and 9-hour forecasts. The numerical weather prediction model utilized in GDAS is the Global Forecast System (GFS).

Data is available at three-hour intervals across 23 constant pressure levels, ranging from 1000 hPa (approximately sea level) to 20 hPa (about 26 km), on a global grid with 1-degree latitude and longitude spacing (180 by 360). Each dataset also includes surface-level data. The data is organized into weekly files and is accessible online.
