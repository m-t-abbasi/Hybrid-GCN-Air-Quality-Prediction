üìç South Korea

The structure for collecting air pollution data in South Korea is systematically organized, involving collaboration among governmental, research, and local agencies. The Ministry of Environment (MOE) formulates national policies and standards for air quality and collects data from monitoring stations nationwide. The National Environmental Corporation Agency (NECA) oversees and manages the air quality monitoring network, collecting data, analyzing it, and publishing reports. Local environmental agencies implement the functions of MOE and NECA at the local level, monitoring air quality in cities and reporting results. Air quality monitoring stations across the country continuously collect data on various pollutants, which is sent to relevant organizations. This data is publicly released after processing, allowing citizens to access real-time air quality information through websites and mobile applications. South Korea also collaborates with international organizations to share data and adopt best practices for improving air quality.
In South Korea, several reputable websites collect and publish data related to air pollution and the environment. Here are some of the key websites:

- [Ministry of Environment Website](https://me.go.kr/home/web/main.do) : Information on policies and regulations for environmental issues in South Korea.

The Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) is an atmospheric model developed by NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). It provides analyses four times daily (at 0, 6, 12, and 18 UTC) along with 3-, 6-, and 9-hour forecasts. The numerical weather prediction model utilized in GDAS is the Global Forecast System (GFS).

Data is available at three-hour intervals across 23 constant pressure levels, ranging from 1000 hPa (approximately sea level) to 20 hPa (about 26 km), on a global grid with 1-degree latitude and longitude spacing (180 by 360). Each dataset also includes surface-level data. The data is organized into weekly files and is accessible online.
