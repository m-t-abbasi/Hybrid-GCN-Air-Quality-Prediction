**Abstract**<br> 
Predicting air pollutant concentrations is crucial for pollution prevention and early warnings. This project proposes **RCL-Learning**, a model combining **ResNet** for spatial feature extraction and **ConvLSTM** for spatiotemporal sequence learning. Key highlights:  
- **Accurate multi-city PM2.5 predictions** with RMSE ranging from **5.478 to 13.622** for 1- to 3-hour tasks.  
- **Robust multiscale forecasting** with an average RMSE of **22.927** for 1- to 15-hour tasks.  
- Improved prediction performance over traditional models and other neural network approaches.

**Model Architecture**   
1. **ResNet**  
   - Extracts spatial distribution features of pollutant concentrations and meteorological data.  
2. **ConvLSTM**  
   - Captures spatiotemporal dependencies from the ResNet-extracted features for accurate forecasting.

# üåç RLSTM-LSTM: Read-First LSTM for Air Pollutant Prediction  

**A Novel Encoder-Decoder Model Based on Read-First LSTM for Air Pollutant Prediction**  

[![DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/DOI-https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144507-blue)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.144507)

**Abstract**    
Predicting air pollutant concentrations is crucial for effective environmental management and pollution prevention. In this study, we propose **RLSTM**, a Read-First LSTM that addresses the dependency between gate units, enabling better long-term feature extraction compared to traditional RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs.  
We combine RLSTM as the Encoder and LSTM as the Decoder to build an **Encoder-Decoder System (EDSModel)** for air pollutant prediction. Key highlights of our findings:  
- Superior **long-term prediction accuracy** with RMSE of **30.218** for 1 to 24-hour tasks.  
- Overcomes traditional challenges in time-series modeling.
